<!--
The following is a template to help you write your RFC. You don't have to strictly follow this template, but it should help you to consider the various aspects of your proposal. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the PR or in the Pact Slack community.
-->
## Summary

A one-paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it were already a part of Pact. That generally means:

- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Pact users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Pact. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing Pact users and new Pact users.
- Discuss how this impacts existing Pacts, and the Pact ecosystem in general.

## Reference-level explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC but could be addressed independently in future solutions?

## Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the Pact specification, Pact users, and the ecosystem in a holistic way. This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.  The section merely provides additional information.
