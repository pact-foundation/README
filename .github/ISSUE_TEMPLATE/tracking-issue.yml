        This is a tracking issue for an approved RFC. It is expected that the issue will be updated as the implementation progresses.

        Typically, the implementation will require changes across a number of other repositories within the Pact ecosystem. This issue should link to all of these related issues.

        GitHub can automatically monitor the implementation of related issues by using the following markdown:

        ```markdown
        - [ ] pact-foundation/{repository}#{issue_number}
        ```
